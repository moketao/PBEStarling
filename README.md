PushButtonEngine + Starling Framework = PBEStarling
===

[PBEStarling](http://github.com/zodouglass/PBEStarling) is a set of wrapper components based on the PBE rendering2D, using Starling to render to Stage3D for hardware acceleration.

PushButton Engine is a framework for Flash game development. Build your game 
with reusable gameplay, physics, rendering, and networking components.

Starling is a pure ActionScript 3 library that mimics the conventional Flash display list architecture. 
In contrast to conventional display objects, however, all content is rendered directly by the GPU — providing a rendering performance unlike anything before. 
This is made possible by Flash's "Stage3D" technology.
